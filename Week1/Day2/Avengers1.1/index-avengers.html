                The son of Odin uses his mighty abilities as the god of thunder to protect his home Asgard
                and planet
                Earth alike. Thor Odinson wields the power of the ancient Asgardians to fight evil throughout the Nine
                Realms.

            <h2 id="early">Early Life</h2>
            <p>Thor had an idyllic childhood, brought up in Asgard as the most treasured son of Odin and his wife
                Frigga. His best friend and playmate was his adopted brother Loki, and though the brothers were both
                rivals for their father's throne, they still remained close companions.</p>

                <br>
            <h2 id="warrior">Warrior Years</h2>
            Thor proved himself a great warrior, often leading his own band of warriors into battle, which included
            Sif, Loki, as well as the Warriors Three on adventures which he would describe as being glorious.
            However, he was also known to be reckless when Loki jokingly reminded him that he would be dead had he
            not used a smoke veil to allow them to escape during one battle.</p>
            <h2 id="realms">War of the Nine Realms</h2>
            <p>Having brought Loki back to Asgard, Thor discovered that Vanaheim was getting slowly taken over by
                Marauders who were now taking advantage of the chaotic time. Thor gave Heimdall the Tesseract so he that
                could use its energy to repair the Rainbow Bridge so that the Asgardians could access the Bifrost Bridge
                once more in order to protect the Nine Realms once again.</p>
